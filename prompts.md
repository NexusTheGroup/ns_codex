# PROMPTS.md — Codex Runbook (VS Code)

**Purpose**: A single, start‑to‑finish prompt pack for running the entire project inside **VS Code + Codex (GPT‑5‑Codex)**. These prompts **follow `AGENTS.md`** and enforce *no‑stop* acceptance criteria.

> **How to use**
> 1) Install the Codex VS Code extension and sign in. Choose **Model: GPT‑5‑Codex**.
> 2) Open your repo (must contain `AGENTS.md` and `blueprint.md`).
> 3) Paste the **Kickoff** prompt, then paste each **Phase** prompt when you’re ready to proceed.
> 4) Keep Reasoning = **High** for planning/refactors/security; default to **Medium** otherwise. Only use **Minimal** for bulk mechanical transforms.

## Global Contract (derived from `AGENTS.md`)
- **Source of truth**: `./blueprint.md` (scope) + `AGENTS.md` (process & no‑stop).
- **Permissions**: Workspace‑only edits; network **off** unless explicitly allow‑listed with rationale. No secrets in code; use `.env.example` + `docs/ENV.md`.
- **Branch/PR hygiene**: short‑lived branches, tests first, PR template with Finding Card, `@codex` review.
- **Acceptance gates (global)**: do **not** conclude until:
  1) All phase deliverables exist & are linked from `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`.
  2) `scripts/smoke_test.sh` exits **0** locally.
  3) CI is green on default branch (unit/integration/e2e).
  4) `docs/ENV.md` lists all runtime env vars; `.env.example` updated.
  5) Release notes appended to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Kickoff (Reasoning: **High**)
**Lead Personas**: The Weaver, Aurora

```prompt
You are GPT‑5‑Codex in VS Code. Follow `AGENTS.md` strictly.
Goal: Convert `./blueprint.md` into a concrete, testable plan and contracts.
Deliverables (commit to repo):
 1) docs/BUILD_PLAN.md — Phases P1..P5 with tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
 2) docs/TEST_MATRIX.md — unit/integration/e2e per feature with pass/fail gates.
 3) docs/API_SURFACE.md — OpenAPI sketch for all endpoints referenced in the blueprint.
 4) docs/DB_SCHEMA.sql — Postgres 15 (and pgvector if specified), indexes + migration plan.
 5) docs/TODO.md — live task list mirroring your internal panel.

Constraints & Rules:
- No network unless you ask for allow‑listed domains with rationale.
- Workspace‑only changes. No secrets. Update `.env.example` and `docs/ENV.md` if needed.
- Create short‑lived branches and PRs when appropriate; request `@codex` review.

No‑Stop Acceptance for Kickoff:
- All 5 deliverables exist, cross‑linked, lint‑clean.
- Local `bash scripts/smoke_test.sh` exits 0; add/adjust tests to make it pass.
- CI boots and executes at least the sanity tests; fix issues until green.
- Propose branch/PR plan for P1..P3 and WAIT for "Proceed P1".
```

## Phase Prompts

### P1 — Foundation (Reasoning: **Medium** → spike **High** for schema/migrations)
**Lead Personas**: Orion, Tracee, Lumen, Aletheia (support)

```prompt
Implement Phase P1 from docs/BUILD_PLAN.md. Work in parallel sub‑tasks with short‑lived branches and PRs. Per PR: tests first.
Targets:
- Backend foundation: DB migrations, DAL/repository layer, `/health` & `/ready` endpoints with real checks.
- Ingest pipeline: parsers, checksum dedupe, MIME detection, attachment extraction; idempotent re‑runs.
- Frontend basics: minimal UI with search + thread viewer; accessibility checklist.
- Supply‑chain: lockfiles, SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX), dependency policy, deterministic builds.

Acceptance (per sub‑task):
- Unit tests and smoke pass locally and in CI.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/ENV.md` updated if applicable.
- Finding Card added to PR with risk & acceptance.
Finish P1 when all sub‑tasks are merged and e2e smoke passes.
```

### P2 — Analysis & Retrieval (Reasoning: **Medium**, spike **High** for evaluation design)
**Lead Personas**: Helix, Orion (support)

```prompt
Implement Phase P2: analysis stack and retrieval.
Targets:
