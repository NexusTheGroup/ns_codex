# API Surface â€” Personal AI Chat Manager

## Design Principles
- RESTful JSON interface hosted locally; default binding 127.0.0.1 with no auth for single-user mode.
- Versioned routes under /v1 for forward compatibility.
- Consistent response envelope: { "data": ..., "meta": { "request_id": string, "duration_ms": integer } }.
- Errors follow { "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "details": array } }.

## Pagination & Filtering
- Default limit 25, maximum 100. Responses include meta.total_count and meta.next_offset when more data exists.
- Filters accept JSON object with keys: platforms, roles, topics, entities, tags, date_range, content_type.
- Sorting options vary per resource but share keywords: relevance (default), created_at, updated_at, quality_score.

## Conventions
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 UTC.
- Text fields support Markdown; attachments reference storage paths resolved via server-side streaming.
- Long-running jobs (import, export, reweave) emit job identifiers and surface progress percent plus error arrays.
- Optional webhooks for local automations; otherwise polling via job endpoints.

## Authentication & Security
- Default local mode: no authentication, bind to loopback interface only.
- Optional LAN mode: single API key passed in Authorization Bearer header plus IP allowlist configuration.
- Rate limiting: soft limit 60 requests per minute per allowed IP when LAN mode enabled.
- Request and response logging stored locally with rotation; sensitive fields (API key, tokens) redacted in logs.

## Error Codes (examples)
| Code | Meaning | Typical HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| validation_failed | Input failed schema or business validation. | 400 |
| not_found | Resource missing or not visible to user. | 404 |
| conflict | Concurrent update or duplicate detection triggered. | 409 |
| model_offline | Required local model unavailable. | 503 |
| rate_limited | Request exceeded configured limits. | 429 |

## Extensibility Notes
- Future versions may add GraphQL overlay or websocket channel for live updates; keep /v1 stable and version new features under /v2 when required.
- Consider fine-grained scopes when introducing multi-user mode; reuse API key mechanism as stepping stone.
- Document delta in docs/API_SURFACE.md and capture change summary in docs/CHANGELOG.md release notes.
