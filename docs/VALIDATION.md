# Documentation Validation

Summary of gaps or contradictions discovered during repository scan.

## Missing Artifacts
- Branch protection rules enforcing required checks/reviews (configure in GitHub UI).
- docs/BUILD_PLAN.md, docs/TEST_MATRIX.md, docs/API_SURFACE.md, docs/DB_SCHEMA.sql (required by AGENTS.md Phase P0).
- SECURITY.md (referenced in PROMPTS.md for later phases).
- docs/CHANGELOG.md Release Notes section (global acceptance requires it).
- Detailed environment notes in docs/ENV.md (currently placeholder).

## Inconsistencies
- blueprint.md stored as a single physical line, making diffs and paragraph references difficult.
- scripts/setup.sh writes .env.example but docs/ENV.md lacks matching explanations.

## Checks Performed
- All markdown files enumerated (58) and docs markdown subset (1 prior to this run) reviewed.
- Configs (package.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, pyproject.toml), CI workflow, scripts, and sanity tests inspected.
