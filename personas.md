# PERSONAS.md — Persona Kit & Codex Cloud Long‑Run Plan

This file complements **AGENTS.md** and **PROMPTS.md**. It provides the **persona pack (with backstories)** and a **Codex Cloud long‑run plan** so GPT‑5‑Codex can work for hours without stopping, while keeping VS Code as the cockpit.

> **Model & Modes (quick)**  
> Use **GPT‑5‑Codex** inside Codex. Reasoning: **High** for planning/refactors/security/perf; **Medium** for steady implementation; **Minimal/Low** for bulk mechanical transforms.

## Persona Pack (10)
Each persona includes: Backstory → Mandate → Success Criteria → Operating Directives → Guardrails → Owned Phases/Prompts → Handoffs.

## Codex Cloud Long‑Run Plan
Long tasks (builds/evals/refactors) run better in **Codex Cloud**. Keep VS Code as the coordinator; hand off heavy subtasks to cloud with network **OFF by default** (allow‑list when truly needed).

### Cloud Environment
- **Image**: codex‑universal (default) with Node LTS + Python 3.11.  
- **Approvals**: `Auto` (ask before leaving workspace/network).  
- **Network**: OFF; enable allowlist only when required (e.g., npmjs.org/pypi.org).  
- **Secrets**: none by default; use `.env.example`.  
- **Setup hooks**: call `scripts/setup.sh` first; provide `scripts/maintenance.sh` if needed.

### Task Topology (parallel)
Create **four** cloud tasks for P1, then proceed phase‑by‑phase:
1) **P1‑DB** (Owner: Orion) — migrations, indexes, DAL, health/ready.  
2) **P1‑Ingest** (Owner: Orion/Helix) — parsers, checksums, attachments.  
3) **P1‑Frontend** (Owner: Lumen) — minimal UI, router, a11y checks.  
4) **P1‑SupplyChain** (Owner: Tracee) — lockfiles, SBOM, CI drift checks.

Repeat for P2 (IR & evals), P3 (fusion + HITL), P4 (security/docs/obs), P5 (perf/scale).

### Cloud Task Template (paste into each task)
```
You are GPT‑5‑Codex running as a Codex Cloud task. Follow AGENTS.md and PERSONAS.md.
Phase: <P1‑DB | P1‑Ingest | P1‑Frontend | P1‑SupplyChain | ...>
Deliverables: Implement sub‑targets from docs/BUILD_PLAN.md for this task.
Process:
- Create/checkout short‑lived branch.
- Write tests first; implement; run locally; open PR; request @codex review.
- Update docs (CHANGELOG, ENV, SECURITY if security‑related).
No‑Stop Acceptance (per task):
- Unit + smoke tests pass locally and in CI.
- PR merged or blocked with explicit, actionable comments you will address.
- TODO list updated and empty for this task.
If blocked on approvals, WAIT and post a concise dependency note.
```

### Recovery / Resume (Cloud or Local)
If interrupted, reconstruct state from: branch list, CI status, `docs/TODO.md`, and recent PRs. Rebuild the task list and continue current phase until acceptance is satisfied.

---

## Start‑to‑Finish Super‑Prompt (single paste)
Use this if you want Codex to manage all phases with minimal intervention. Paste in VS Code (local) **or** as a **Codex Cloud** umbrella task.

```
You are GPT‑5‑Codex. Obey AGENTS.md and PERSONAS.md. Work from `blueprint.md`.
Operate phase‑wise: P0→P5. For each phase, decompose into sub‑tasks, spawn branches/PRs, write tests first, run smoke, update docs, and merge.
Global No‑Stop Acceptance:
1) All phase deliverables exist & linked in docs/BUILD_PLAN.md.
2) scripts/smoke_test.sh exits 0 locally.
3) CI green on default branch (unit/integration/e2e that apply).
4) docs/ENV.md lists all env vars; .env.example updated.
5) Release notes appended to docs/CHANGELOG.md.
Modes: High for planning/refactors/security/perf; Medium for steady work; Minimal only for mechanical transforms. Network OFF unless allow‑listed with rationale. NEVER add secrets.
When a phase completes, start the next automatically until all acceptance conditions are satisfied.
```

---

## Handoff & Review Rituals
- Open PRs with a **Finding Card** summarizing: context, risk, tests, acceptance.  
- Ask **@codex** for code review; address comments; re‑run CI.  
- After merge: update `docs/TASKLOG.md` with timestamp + outcome.

---

## Endgame
The **Weaver** validates that acceptance gates from **AGENTS.md** are met, signs off, and tags the release. If any gate fails, reopen the phase with a short remediation plan.
